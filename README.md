# Scheduling Algorithm

## Overview

This document outlines the algorithm and planning decisions made for the Fleet360 project, focusing on the core logic and design choices.

## Algorithm Description

The algorithm's primary goal is to optimize [Specify the goal of the algorithm, e.g., vehicle routing, resource allocation, task scheduling]. It achieves this by employing a [Specify the type of algorithm, e.g., heuristic, greedy, dynamic programming] approach.

### Key Steps

1.  **Input Processing:** The algorithm begins by processing the input data, which includes [List the input data, e.g., vehicle locations, task requirements, time constraints].
2.  **Initialization:**  [Describe the initialization process, e.g., creating initial routes, assigning resources].
3.  **Optimization:** The core of the algorithm involves iteratively improving the solution. This is done by [Describe the optimization process, e.g., swapping tasks, re-routing vehicles, adjusting resource allocation].
4.  **Evaluation:** At each step, the algorithm evaluates the current solution based on [List the evaluation criteria, e.g., total distance traveled, task completion time, resource utilization].
5.  **Termination:** The algorithm terminates when [Describe the termination condition, e.g., a maximum number of iterations is reached, a satisfactory solution is found].
6. **Output:** The algorithm outputs the optimized solution, which includes [Describe the output, e.g., vehicle routes, task assignments, resource schedules].
